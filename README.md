# 🌿 Crop Disease Detector

A deep learning-based web application that detects crop diseases from plant leaf images using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Upload plant leaf images to detect diseases
- Accurate CNN-based predictions
- Clean web interface using Flask
- Saves prediction history in a database

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify plant diseases. CNNs are ideal for image classification tasks because they can automatically learn and extract spatial features from images.
